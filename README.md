# Bounty Ratings
Bounty Ratings is a page that allows you to track and choose the best self-hosted bug bounty programs, offering good payouts and fast response times. The main goal of this page is to protect researchers and their time from scam bug bounty programs that either do not respond or fail to pay any bounties despite claiming to do so.

## Rating System
### Circles:
- A red circle means the company is not recommended for submitting reports, as they violate the rules of their own bug bounty program.
- A green circle indicates that you are welcome to submit your reports.

The next three colors in this column represent First Response, Communication, and Payout:
### First Response: Indicates whether the company responded to your report.
- Red: No response.
- Green: Responded.
- 
### Communication: Represents the quality of communication.
- Red: Ignored you or poor communication.
- Green: Good communication.
### Payout: Reflects whether the bounty was paid.
- Red: No payout.
- Green: Successfully paid.
